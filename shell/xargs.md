# xargs

xargs is a command in Unix/Linux that takes input from stdin and converts it into command-line arguments for another command.

```bash
# move files in bulk
ls *.txt | xargs mv -t backup_folder/
# Find .log files, count lines, and save to a summary file:
find . -name "*.log" | xargs cat | tee all_logs.txt | wc -l
```
